Title: Introduction to Limits

Status: draft

Limit is a very simple idea that is central to calculus.

$$
f(x) = {x - 1 \over x - 1}
$$

You might think that you could just simplify thins function to $f(x)=1$, but in fact it's not possible, when $x=1$ this function will be undefined, because division by zero is not possible.
