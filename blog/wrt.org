***** don't try to enjoy computer game without playing it
*****  I do not have any problem with cheating or stealing or killing.
Interesting. I do not have any problem with cheating or stealing or killing.
I don't do this just because it is not elegant or creative, because not
playing by LG rules makes your mind weak and you pathetic. It has nothing to
do with morality, it just doesn't need to be done, when I don't cheat I'm
forced to be strong and clever. That gives me the things you can't purchase -
love, self esteem, mind.
***** Avoiding making decisions is just pathetic and annoying.
Don't be a James taggart! Maybe we could possibly do that if you would maybe
consider the other the thing but I guess another option is also jot entirely
impossible. WTF is that! Make up your mind and tell them what you need! It has
nothing to do with politeness, it is about knowing what you want. If you don't
know - figure it out. Avoiding making decisions is just pathetic and annoying.
***** Top core concepts.
***** HC. More than life. Burning. HC.
intensity. more than life. amplify. basic pleasure, flow, strong associations. being emptied out at the end of the day.//fighting pain.
basic flow/joy > amplify.
not separate from life - bigger than life, higher form of existence - more
present, more aware, more switched on.
It's not life vs work. This IS the best form of life. //this is the best
within us.
***** Why I will win or die trying.
Wiy I will become one of these people or die rying. Glimpses of the state of
glory - sharp, alert, aware, crystal clarity of consciousness, laser beam of
focus.
***** WOrld is awesome enough without magic. Fuch harry potter, science is the REAL magic.
why my kids won't believe in santa. Wonders of science vs bs of superstition.
***** Egoism vs altruism. AR vs eebn pegan.
***** no excuse for negative emotions, they're counterproductie
(unless it's healthy version, calculated to be the leverage).
*****  tipping point, pain outweights the effort.
       guiltless joy of acting like a man, having principles and integrity.
***** Flow.
***** How I choose the business and everythingn Iâ€™ve learned about it at this point.
      Time to start making these vids/blog.

***** Emotions are irrelevant. mind over emotions.
***** Shortcommings are irrelevant.
***** You CAN compare cities and people.
***** Why lev is wrong.
How the fuck can he talk even about the good stuff about humanity and
sound so freakin depressing! I know it's appealing to some people..
And hey, I love his videos for the wit, and I can do better!
***** Why I'm against anti drug people.(+anti gay)
***** At some point say something about religion. It's hard to do in a right way, but I can. not in a obvious boring way, but...
***** On trusting your judgement.
***** love. expression of our highest values. settling for anything less is
betrayal. fuck unconditional love. You gotta deserve each other every fucking
day. you find your best option, and make your value as high as you can to be
her best option, to deserve it. and that way you exchange value.
and you forced to grow by the way too) because once one person gets better - he
starts to have better options, so you gotta up your value as well)
***** Intensity. Extreme. No compromise.
***** No joy vs hardwork debate. BTFA.
***** EP(/basic mvp)+direction(/perfect vision)+action(get on with it)+steering.
***** Willpower. Marshmellow experiment.
***** Info under practice.
***** Thinking tools.
