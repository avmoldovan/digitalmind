This is the list of practical applications of ML with some examples.

Machine learning is used in

- Web search
  google works based on ML algorithm
- Spam filters
- Recommender systems
- Stock trading
- Credit card fraud detection
- Stock trading
- Drug design
- Computer vision and object recognition
like in robotic cars, or face recognition in photos

It is in every field.
Autonomous robotics,

Analyzing data:
computational biology(understanding genes sequences or recognizing diseases) , web and startups and analyzing data for business, finance, medicine, engineering.

Applications you can't program by hand:
Autonomous helicopters(teaching it to fly),
handwriting recognition(for example routing letters),
natural language processing(siri, google now), Computer Vision(robotic cars)

Recommender systems. Amazon/Netflix

Computational neuroscience.
