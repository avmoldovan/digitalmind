Status: draft

First of all - the general overview of all the major topics, and the order in which to study them
(made based on the overview of the Deep Learning from [metacademy](http://metacademy.org/roadmaps/rgrosse/deep_learning))

Now - the list of resources and projects, in order of learning:


##  1. Andrew Ng course
Andrew Ng [Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/course/ml),  
supplemented with his [course on Deep learning ](http://openclassroom.stanford.edu/MainFolder/CoursePage.php?course=ufldl), and Neural Networks explanation from [Pedro Domingos ML course](https://class.coursera.org/machlearning-001/lecture/preview)(for things that are unclear).

Learn the basics of math in the process, as needed from Khan Academy([Calculus](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL19E79A0638C8D449), [Linear Algebra](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFD0EB975BA0CC1E0), [Probability](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC58778F28211FA19) & [Statistics](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1328115D3D8A2566).)

Projects:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Feed Forward Neural Network
- Backpropagation


## 2. Neural Networks for Machine Learning
Geoffrey Hinton's coursera course "[Neural Networks for Machine Learning](https://class.coursera.org/neuralnets-2012-001/lecture)", supplemented with  MIT Book on [Deep Learning](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~bengioy/dlbook/) and [UFLDL tutorial by Stanford](http://deeplearning.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/UFLDL_Tutorial) (alternative [link](http://deeplearning.stanford.edu/tutorial/))

Projects:

- Implement neural network with back-propagation to recognize hand-written digits from MNIST database:  
  [Digit Recognizer Kaggle contest](http://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer)

## 3. UFLD Tutorial
After understaning gradient descent and neural networks with back-propagation go through the [UFLDL tutorial by Stanford](http://deeplearning.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/UFLDL_Tutorial)

And read MIT Book on [Deep Learning](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~bengioy/dlbook/).

Projects:

- Understand autoencoders, Restricted Boltzmann machines, create Deep Belief nets.
