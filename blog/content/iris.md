Title: Multiclass Classification of Flower Species
Date: 2016-07-23
Slug: iris
Status: draft


The purpose of this project is to learn the basics of training an ANN on a simple example. I will use Keras, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn to train ANN that will classify flower species based on a few basic parameters.
  

## Iris Dataset

I will use a simple dataset that describes different species of flowers and their properties. There are 3 species of iris flowers(Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor), and the dataset contains examples, describing the properties of each flower (the length and the width of the sepals and petals), and the species it belongs to. The goal is to predict the species of a flower based on these parameters.

The data looks like this:
```
5.1,3.5,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa
5.0,3.3,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa
....
7.0,3.2,4.7,1.4,Iris-versicolor
6.4,3.2,4.5,1.5,Iris-versicolor
....
6.3,3.3,6.0,2.5,Iris-virginica
5.8,2.7,5.1,1.9,Iris-virginica
```
