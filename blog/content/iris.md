Status: draft


I will use a [simple dataset], that describes different species of flowers and their properties. There are 3 species of flowers(,,,), and the dataset contains examples, describing petal width and length, and sepal width/length. The goal is to predict the species of a flower based on these parameters.

Here's how it looks like:
