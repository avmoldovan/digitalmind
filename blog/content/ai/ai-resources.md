This is a list of the best resources to learn the foundations of Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning. It will be the most useful for beginners, people who want to get into this field, but don't know where to start.

## Machine Learning

- For the best introduction into Machine Learning field, watch Andrew Ng [Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/course/ml) on Coursera. It explains the basic concepts and gives you a good understanding of most important algorithms.

- For a short, high level overview of ML algorithms, check out a great TutsPlus course “[Machine Learning Distilled](http://code.tutsplus.com/courses/machine-learning-distilled)”.

- A book “[Programming Collective Intelligence](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Collective-Intelligence-Building-Applications/dp/0596529325)” is an excellent resource to learn the practical implementation of ML algorithms in python. It takes you through a lot of practical projects, covering all of the necessary fundamentals.

Other great resources you might want to check out are:

- [Pedro Domingos ML course](https://class.coursera.org/machlearning-001/lecture/preview)

- [Udacity Course on ML](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs271) by Perer Norvig

- [Another course on ML](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/%7Etom/10701_sp11/lectures.shtml) taught at Carnegie Mellon University by Tom Mitchell.

## Deep Learning

The best introduction to Deep Learning that I have encountered is [Deep Learning With Python](https://machinelearningmastery.com/deep-learning-with-python/). This book gives you a quick, practical introduction into the field.

After that, to get more in depth, here are some interesting resources:

- Geoffrey Hinton’s coursera course “[Neural Networks for Machine Learning](https://class.coursera.org/neuralnets-2012-001/lecture)”

- MIT Book on [Deep Learning](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/%7Ebengioy/dlbook/)

- [UFLDL tutorial by Stanford](http://deeplearning.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/UFLDL_Tutorial) (alternative [link](http://deeplearning.stanford.edu/tutorial/))

- [deeplearning.net tutorials](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/)

- NYU Course on [Deep Learning](http://techtalks.tv/deep_learning_nyu_spring_2014/)

* Book “[Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/)” by Michael Nielsen

* Book Neural “[Networks and Learning Machines](http://www.amazon.com/Neural-Networks-Learning-Machines-Edition/dp/0131471392)” by Simon O. Haykin

* [deeplearning.net reading list](http://deeplearning.net/reading-list/)

## Artificial Intelligence
- Book "[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (AIMA)](http://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Modern-Approach-Edition/dp/0136042597)"  
  This is the best book about the "old school" AI, it covers most of the topics and fields of AI, and if you will read it - you will have a very solid foundations of the field. This is definitely the best place to start.

- [Artificial Intelligence course](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCshmLD2MsyqAKBx8ctivb5Q/videos) from UC Berkeley(CS 188)  
  This is an excellent course from Berkeley, series of video lectures, a lot of them are based on AIMA, it is a perfect complement to the book, it will make it much more understandable and enjoyable to read. Plus there's great practical projects.


## How mind works:
On the opposite end of a spectrum - here's some fantastic(and very entertaining)
books about how human mind works. It is not necessary very practical, but they
are very exciting and fun to read, and obviously understanding of human brain
can be very useful. At the very least - you will be inspired and enjoy reading
them a lot.

- Jeff Hawkins - On Intelligence  
  <http://www.amazon.com/On-Intelligence-Jeff-Hawkins/dp/0805078533>  
  Audiobook: <http://www.audible.com/pd/Science-Technology/On-Intelligence-Audiobook/B002V8LK>  

- Ray Kurzweil - How to Create a Mind:  
  <http://www.amazon.com/How-Create-Mind-Thought-Revealed/dp/0143124048/>  
  Audiobook: <http://www.audible.com/pd/Science-Technology/How-to-Create-a-Mind-Audiobook/B009S7OKJ>  

- Principles of Neural Science  
  <http://www.amazon.com/Principles-Neural-Science-Edition-Kandel/dp/00713901>  
	This is the best book I could find that goes in depth into NS. 2 books above presented the general theories how mind works, this one talks about hardcore science, neuro-anatomy and such. Very interesting, but also very long - I'm still reading it.

### General Coputer Science
(algorithms, data structures, complexity)

- [MIT course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Op3QLzMgSY&list=PLE18841CABEA24090#t=253)
(based on [SICP book](http://www.amazon.com/Structure-Interpretation-Computer-Programs-Engineering/dp/0262510871))  
  This is a course on lisp and basics of computer science, based on one of the most influential and seminal books in CS - "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs".

## Programming
## Prerequisites

### Lisp and Python - best programming languages for AI:
Of all the programming languages you can choose to practice AI there are 2 best
options: Lisp and Python. Lisp was created specifically for creating AI, and it
is widely considered to be the most elegant and brilliant programming language
ever.  

Here's the best way to learn it:  

- Book "[Land of Lisp](http://www.amazon.com/Land-Lisp-Learn-Program-Game/dp/1593272812/)"
  (Book about lisp with some AI algorithms)  
  This is an excellent and very fun introduction to lisp, makes learning very
  enjoyable, understandable, and includes a lot of algorithms and basic principles
  that will be very useful when you will be going throuhg AIMA.  


- Paul Graham [ANSI Common Lisp](http://www.amazon.com/ANSI-Common-LISP-Paul-Graham/dp/0133708756)

And here's my favorite book on python:  

- [Dive Into Python 3](http://www.diveintopython3.net/)
