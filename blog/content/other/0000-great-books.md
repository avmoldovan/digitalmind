### Catch Me If You Can by Frank Abagnale

I remember disliking the movie, but the book is brilliant and hilarious. Autobiography of one of the boldest, horniest, and most brilliant con artists.

###  Ghost In The Wires by Kevin Mitnick

On the same topic, autobiography of a great hacker. Extremely clever and awesome. I bet people here will love it.

### Zero to One by Peter Thiel

Very intelligent and inspiring book about startups and new technologies. A lot of new and great ideas, I've enjoyed it a lot.

### iWoz

Autobiography of Steve Wozniak. Also wonderful and super positive and inspiring story.

### Trust me, I'm lying.

Book about how modern social media is being manipulated. Short and interesting. Makes you think differently about what you read on the internet.

### On Intelligence by Jeff Hawkins
Theory of how human mind works. Must read for everyone who is into AI, but also a great book for everyone else.
